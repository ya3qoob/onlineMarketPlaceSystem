Online Marketplace System
Overview
The Online Marketplace System is a Java application that incorporates various programming concepts
to create a robust and feature-rich platform. It encompasses a wide range of concepts, including
Classes, Constructors, Encapsulation, Association, Polymorphism, Exception Handling, Text I/O,
Abstract Classes and Interfaces, Concurrency, Graphical User Interface (GUI), and Multi-threading.

Key Concepts and Features

Classes and Constructors:Utilize object-oriented principles to create classes that represent different entities in the online marketplace.

Encapsulation:Apply encapsulation to protect the internal state of objects and control access to their attributes.

Association:Establish associations between different classes to represent relationships within the marketplace system.

Polymorphism:Implement polymorphic behavior to allow different classes to be treated as instances of a common superclass.

Exception Handling:Employ exception handling mechanisms to manage errors and unexpected situations gracefully.

Text I/O:Use text input and output to interact with users and display information.

Abstract Classes and Interfaces:Define abstract classes and interfaces to create a flexible and extensible architecture.

Concurrency and Multi-threading:Implement concurrent processing and multi-threading to enhance system performance.

Graphical User Interface (GUI):Develop a user-friendly GUI for seamless interaction with the online marketplace.
